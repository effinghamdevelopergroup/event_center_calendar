# Project
We are building a Calendar Application that will focus on a event centers room rentals.

Ryan has an event center and he is looking to organize his room rentals. He is currently keeping his rooms in an excel sheet, but it has become bloated and difficult to manage. Phone calls are not the preferred method of contact. Ryan wants to begin using email notifications that will be created from a website by a user when requesting to rent a room.

# Project Technologies
For this project we have decided to use Ruby on Rails. We believe it will be the quickest why to get an application up and running in the environment we've chosen.

We will use Bootstrap 4.0 in order to accommodate different devices connecting to the application. Bootstrap has a great base of classes and viewports already configured for us to take advantage of.

Javascript will be used for functionalities and design.

# Project Needs
We will need to supply Ryan with the following.
* a calendar view to oversee each rooms availability.
* the ability to manage users who register on the application.
* allow the users to submit room rentals based on a block of time.
* notifications to the administration when a room rental comes in.
* sending a email notification to users when their notification is approved.
* a mobile friendly interface using bootstrap.
